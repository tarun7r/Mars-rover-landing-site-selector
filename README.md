# Mars-rover-landing-site-selector
<p> This Python script analyses the terrain of Mars and estimates the optimum landing places for Mars rovers using Standard Deviation and Peak-to-Valley data. </p>
<p>
This is done using the MOLA (Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter) map, which depicts the geographical heights of Mars. Allowing us to locate the best landing sites for the Rover on Mars. </p>
<p>
What is mola, and why should we utilise it rather than regular images?
</p>
<p>Data extracted from Nasa website (https://attic.gsfc.nasa.gov/mola/images.html)
The Mars Global Surveyor MOLA and MOC teams collaborated to create the National Geographic Map of Mars for the National Geographic Society.

It's a Mars picture made up of 200 million MOLA laser altimeter data plus 1,000 MOC wide-angle photographs.
The picture data offers accurate colour due to Mars' dusty atmosphere, while the altimetry emphasises characteristics on the surface that aren't evident in photos.
Winkel-Tripel is the visual projection. (This image was created in collaboration with the National Geographic Society, MOLA Science Team, MSS, JPL, and NASA.) </p>

# What it takes to land on Mars
To successfully land a spacecraft, we send it into space with hundreds of thousands of lines of code, providing instructions for each of the maneuvers it will need to perform to land safely, including:
<ul>
<li>Measuring how far it is from the surface
<li>Knowing when to perform each maneuver, such as deploying its parachute
<li>Communicating its status with mission controllers on Earth
<li>And safely beginning operations upon reaching the surface
</ul>
