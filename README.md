# Mars-rover-landing-site-selector
<p>This python project scans the surface of Mars and using Standard Deviation and Peak-to-valley measurements determines the best spots to land a Mars rovers.</p>
<p>This uses the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) map that shows us the terrain elevations on Mars. Allowing us to determine the appropriate locations to land Rover on mars.</p>
<p>what is mola and why should we use it instead of the normal images?</p>
<p>Data extracted from Nasa website (https://attic.gsfc.nasa.gov/mola/images.html)
The National Geographic Map of Mars was produced in a collaborative effort by the Mars Global Surveyor MOLA and MOC teams for the National Geographic Society.

It is an image of Mars that incorporates over 200 million laser altimeter measurements from MOLA and about a thousand wide-angle images from MOC. 
The altimetry accentuates details on the surface not visible in images due to the dusty atmosphere of Mars, and the image data provides realistic color. 
The image projection is Winkel-Tripel. (Image Credit: National Geographic Society, MOLA Science Team, MSS, JPL, NASA.)</p>
# What it takes to land on Mars
To successfully land a spacecraft, we send it into space with hundreds of thousands of lines of code, providing instructions for each of the maneuvers it will need to perform to land safely, including:
<ul>
<li>Measuring how far it is from the surface
<li>Knowing when to perform each maneuver, such as deploying its parachute
<li>Communicating its status with mission controllers on Earth
<li>And safely beginning operations upon reaching the surface
</ul>
